    The RestoreSources property sets the package restore sources for the app.

    The hosting startup package project's bin/Debug folder is included as a
    package source. This permits the app to load the compiled package without 
    publishing the package to nuget.org.

    A local package source folder can reside anywhere, including on a network 
    share. Wherever the package is maintained locally, provide the path to the
    package's location when experimenting with the sample app.

    In a real-world scenario when you deliver a hosting startup NuGet package 
    via nuget.org, the RestoreSources property isn't present and a normal 
    package reference is added to the ItemGroup earlier in this file with the 
    package's published version on nuget.org. Under these conditions, the
    hosting startup is consumed just like any normal NuGet package.

    For demonstration purposes, the hosting startup library's assembly
    is manually placed into this project's bin/Debug folder.

    The following Reference item permits the app to load the hosting startup
    assembly (HostingStartupLibrary.dll) from this app's bin/Debug folder.

    A project reference isn't used to consume the hosting startup library
    because the hosting startup is deployed as a compiled assembly (a DLL 
    file).

    In a production app, the hosting startup assembly can be moved 
    manually into a project (as is done here) or moved automatically using 
    a Content item or script. When forming the path to the assembly, the 
    following variables can be used to automate discovery of the hosting
    startup assembly:

    $(Configuration) - replaced by the configuration (Debug, Release)
    $(TargetFramework) - replaced by the project's target framework
